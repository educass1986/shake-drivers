ShakeAndroid24092010.jar is for Android versions <= 2.2
ShakeAndroid10082011.jar is for Android versions >= 2.3 (not including 3.x!)

The only difference between the two is that the class used to manage Bluetooth connections is called ShakeAndroidBluetooth in the former and ShakeAndroidBluetoothGingerbread in the latter (as the Bluetooth APIs changed in 2.3)
